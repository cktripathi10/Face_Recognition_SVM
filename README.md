# SVM Classification Project

## Project Overview
This project implements Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification using the `faces dataset`. The model's performance is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Features
- Uses the `scikit-learn` library for SVM classification.
- Evaluates model performance using a classification report.
- Visualizes and analyzes class-wise precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Files
- **Exercise_3_SVM_Solution.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis.
- **image.png**: Classification report visualization.
- **data/**: (Optional) Contains input datasets.
- **scripts/**: (Optional) Contains Python scripts used in the project.

## Installation
To run the project:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies:
